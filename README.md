## Hi I'm Veit ðŸ‘‹

I'm a 19 year old Computer Science student at [ETH ZÃ¼rich](https://ethz.ch).

ðŸ”­ I mostly work on: 

- Embedded Projects using ESP32, STM32, Arduino, etc.
- Swift & SwiftUI Applications
- I used to work alot on Minecraft Plugins in Java (they did work well but now are an old relic no one wants to touch)

âš¡ Take a look at [__IgnyteX Labs__](https://github.com/IgnyteX-Labs).

- where I work on some fun projects,
- some of my handy Arduino libraries are hosted,
- and many other things, go take a look.
